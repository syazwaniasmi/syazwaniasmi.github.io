  abstract={We investigated the indirect detection of neutralino dark matter using radio observation. By looking at the energy spectrum of relativistic positron-electron, this method may provide us with the upper limit of neutralino dark matter emission. Neutralino dark matter can emit synchrotron emissions due to the interaction of relativistic positron-electron spectrum energy with the intracluster magnetic field. The synchrotron emission of dark matter highly depends on the dark matter density at the centre of the cluster. By using the cold dark matter model, the density of dark matter can be obtained using Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), Einasto, Diemer and Kravtsov 2014 (DK14) and Hernquist profiles. Using the observed radio halo emission as the maximum emission (from dark matter and other sources), we constrained the neutralino mass (mœá) and neutralino cross-section annihilation „Äà œÉv „Äâ as mœá - „Äà œÉv „Äâ constraint lines. We investigated the effect of different profiles on the mœá - „Äà œÉv „Äâ constraint lines. We also used all the basic annihilation channels for better and stronger constraint lines. Our findings demonstrated the NFW profiles provided us with a good constraint line similarly with previous study. Our results also confirmed that the œÑ+œÑ- and t t ÃÑ channels provide us with a stronger constraint at mœá = 100 GeV and 1000 GeV, respectively. Overall, our findings are consistent for the constraint lines of all the chosen galaxy clusters namely A119, A2199, A2142, A2744, A478 and A2029.}

  abstract={Extensive radio frequency interference (RFI) monitoring is essential in the site selection process before constructing radio astronomy observatories, followed by mitigation strategies to minimize its adverse effects. Malaysia has an enormous prospect for radio astronomy due to its prominent location in the centre of Southeast Asia, but is challenged by its relatively high population density. In this research article, we perform high-cadence, low-frequency RFI monitoring at two sites, each representing an urban and a rural environment. Using modified generalized spectral kurtosis (GSK) as an RFI detection method, we ascertain the suitability of Glami Lemi, a rural area in the centre of Peninsular Malaysia previously assigned as a candidate radio notification zone (RNZ), as a potential site for radio astronomy observations due to its lower RFI contamination in our high-cadence monitoring, especially when compared with urban areas. We identified a number of persistent and transient RFI in our dataset, associate each of them with their potential origins and, if present, characterize their temporal evolution. A few types of RFI mitigation strategies were also tested and discussed. This study lays the groundwork for Malaysia's endeavours in establishing its first research-grade radio telescope, emphasizing the importance of robust RFI detection and mitigation strategies in optimizing observational outcomes.},

  abstract={In this study, we investigate the potential connection between Dark matter (DM) particles and synchrotron emission in galaxy clusters, with a focus on radio relics. We explore three models beyond the standard model of particle physics and calculate emissions from DM particle candidates, comparing the results to radio observations. Our analysis centres on galaxy clusters A4038 and A1664, considering their radio properties and magnetic field characteristics. We employ the Navarro, Frenk, and White (NFW) profile to represent mass density distributions and in situ acceleration models for cosmic ray contributions. We estimate upper limits on DM cross-section annihilation ‚ü®ùúéùë£‚ü© for various DM particle candidates for two decay channels (ùëèùëèÃÑ and ùúá +ùúá ‚àí decay channels). Our findings suggest that the DM is not likely the source of the excess emission, but we acknowledge the potential impact of DM on total radio emissions in galaxy clusters. Further studies are needed to refine excess emissions and assess DM‚Äôs influence on the total radio emissions. In summary, this research delves into the intricate relationship between DM particles and radio emissions in galaxy clusters,emphasizing the need for precise modelling and observation to unveil the mysteries of DM.},
